 * In which no one is actually reading the code and so I create a sign in sheet.
 * If you opened up the thing, and read the code, you came here.
 * And then you put down your name.
 * Because people need to look at code, even if they aren't programming the majority of it.
 * Don't be a jackass and tell people about it.
 * 
 * When you commit to Github, don't make your commit message "signed in to code"
